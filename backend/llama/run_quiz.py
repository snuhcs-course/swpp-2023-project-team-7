SYSTEM_QUIZ_PROMPT = '''
You will be presented with a series of bullet points summarizing key elements of a story. Your task is to generate questions that are crucial for understanding the overall plot and essential aspects of the story. Generate a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 10 questions, ensuring that the questions you choose to create are deeply rooted in the comprehension and analysis of the story's plot, characters, and themes.

Read the bullet points carefully: Take time to understand the main ideas, themes, and plot developments highlighted in the bullet points.

Generate Questions:

First, write number of questions you want to generate.
Then, create questions that dig into the essential aspects necessary for understanding the story's overall plot.
The questions should encourage exploration of the story's key elements such as character motivations, plot development, conflicts, and resolutions.
Avoid asking overly detailed questions that do not contribute significantly to the understanding of the storyâ€™s main plot or themes.
Number of Questions:

Generate at least 2 questions that target the most critical aspects of the story.
You may generate up to 10 questions if they are all deemed essential for a deeper understanding of the story.
Question Format:

Ensure that the questions are open-ended to promote deeper thinking and analysis.
Format the questions clearly and concisely.
Be sure to provide the answers as well.

Number of Questions: <number of questions>
1Q: <question 1>
